I have had an idea to make a game, where you could use your gps to "paint" images on the map.
I dreamed a name, "GeoPaint", but when i checked it on google, it was already reserved with a same game... (http://geopaint.net)
It was a bit buggy, so i decided, i'll make my game, but with a whole new name "MapPaint".


Ohh, and sorry for my English, this isn't my primary (or secondary) language... :)
